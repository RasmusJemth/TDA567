The EnrollmentStation class only contains a set of fingerprint, an init method and a method for
issuing tokens. The use of the class is just to issue tokens. So a set of fingerprints must be
saved so that multiple tokens can't be issued to the same person. The reason why we chose to only
have the issueToken functionality is that nothing else is relevant for a enrollment station,
since the stations only role is to issue new tokens.
Token contains an integer for fingerprint and clearance level. The only functionality of the token
class is its Init method and the method InvalidateToken. The init method is called by
ErollmentStation and initializes the fingerprint and clearance variable.
The InvalidateToken method is called from the IDStn class whenever a faulty attempt to open a door.
The reason we put the Invalidate in the token class in that Token class is that the neither the
IDStn or the Enrollment keep track of the tokens after they are initialize, this also save some
memory.
IDStn contains two booleans alarm and doorOpen, which represents if the door is open and if the
alarm is one/off. Contains one integer for the clearance level of the door. The Init method
initializes the clearance level with the given parameter, and sets the booleans to false.
IDStn have a method TryOpenDoor which is called whenever a person tries to open the door.
It takes a fingerprint and the token from the person trying to open the door, if the entry is correct,
then open the door, if the entry is incorrect, then the alarm is raised, and the token is
invalidated.
The entry is correct if the fingerprint matches the one on the token and the clearance level of the
token is as high or higher than the clearance level of the door.
IDStn also contains the method CloseDoor which sets the doorOpen boolean to false.
