
Bugs were found in the insert and the containsArithTriple method.
The bug in the insert method were that it could add an element twice in some cases, to fix that we change the breaks in the code to "return;"

The bug in the containsArithTriple was due to i could be equals to j (i==j), instead of the condition j<=i in the for loop, we changed it to j<i.

Our test cases satisfies both path and statement coverage(the charts in the folder).
