/*
Question 1
The program failed to verify as x and y can be equal and then
big and small will also be equal which is not allowed by the
post-condition.
*/

/*
Question 2
BEVIS HÃ„R
*/

/*
Fixing the program
The program can either be fixed by a pre-condition such as:
requires x > y || y > x;
or by simply chaning the post-condition to allow for big and small
to be equal.
If we're allowed to change the method we can simply add another if
and set the values to something arbitrary as this doesn't violate
the post-condition.

//Fixed by pre-condition - Question 1

  requires x > y || y > x;
  ensures big > small;
{
  if (x > y)
   {big, small := x, y;}
  else

Additional post-conditions should be added to ensure that the
values of big and small actually come from the parameters x and y.
